# Primality-test
Check if an input number is prime or not  
Primality test (in Python) using two optimization methods in comparison with a naive solution that iterates through all the positive integers less than the input number, to check if any divides it:  
1-Testing integers only up to the square root of the input number (trial division)  
2-Testing integers only of the form 6k Â± 1 after checking if the input number is even or divisible by 3 given that all prime numbers, except 2 and 3, are of this form
